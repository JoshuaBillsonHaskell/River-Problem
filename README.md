# RiverProblem

This project solves the river problem by applying breadth
first search implemented entirely in Haskell. For those unfamiliar
with the problem, a farmer must move a hen, a sack of grain, and a fox
from one side of a river to the other in as few crossings as
possible. He can only take a single item across the river with
him at a time, and he must never leave the fox alone with the hen
or the hen alone with the grain.
